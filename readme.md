**This project is a replica of the website for Ronni's pizzeria . Work has been done to create web pages similar to the original. The work has been done so that the pages are adaptive for different screen resolutions. Javascript is used to create a slider. A total of 7 pages were created, including the main navigation as well as additional pages with news. Most of the images and materials (including the menu) were taken from Ronni's official website.**
